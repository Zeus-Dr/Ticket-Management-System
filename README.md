# Respondent Side of the Ticket Management System


## Description

This web project is about a HelpDesk Ticket Managing system where a person can send a problem to the help desk and get a feedback from the respondent

This is only the respondent side of the project because it the one i was working on as other team members were working on the other sides.

### NOTE
For Better results, create a user manually in the database using phpmyadmin and the assign them a role of respodent the use the interface for others...

Also create accounts for some users since they are the ones that send problems to the respondents to answer...
